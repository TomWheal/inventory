    Manufacured from power-v4-hw.git@4b211aed8e9071729ca3592868cb8989e450f00a

    QMC have reported an issue with this board. It appears that the USB is not
    working: https://www.studentrobotics.org/trac/ticket/2796

    It does not enumerate. I have tried reflashing it and it is still broken.
    It does not turn the fan on or play the firmware version beeps.
